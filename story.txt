Life is too short to spend time 
with people who suck the happiness 
out of you. If someone wants you in 
their life, they’ll make room for 
you You shouldn’t have to fight to a
for a spot. Never, ever insist to
yourself to someone who continuously 
overlooks your worth. And remember, you to a
it’s not the people that stand by your 
side when you’re at your best, 
but the ones who stand beside 
you when you’re at your worst 
that are your true friends.
